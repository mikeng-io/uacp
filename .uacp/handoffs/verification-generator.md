# Handoff — verification-generator

## Intent
Capsule #3 of the verification-method initiative: the **generative gate**. Make an agent's
*"I verified this — it's done"* trustworthy by forcing it to author a **specific runnable check per
claimed target**, freeze it, and have the kernel **re-run it and block "done" if any check is missing,
weak, or failing**. Motivated by Trustless #503 (7 review rounds, bugs still shipped — checks were
rubber stamps). This session: designed the whole gate (council-reviewed) + built the first vertical
(the replay spine). The deeper goal is to close #503 classes **B/C/D** (the comprehend→measure
generation failures) that hardcoded checks can't.

## Decisions & rationale
- [locked] **Typed CLOSED check catalog** (`uacp.check.*`; agent SELECTS + PARAMETERIZES from content,
  never free-form code-gen) — the only way the gate stays auditable + fail-closed; free-form = the black
  box node 10 warns against.
- [locked] **Checks are registered entities projected as `check` nodes with `measured_by` edges** — so
  the gate reuses the whole registration/projection/forced-gate/Engine-Violation spine hardened this
  session, not new machinery.
- [locked] **3 layers of anti-gaming, but framed HONESTLY** — structural coverage (L1) + required-kinds
  floor (L2) + council (L3). The council corrected my overclaim: determinism only **NARROWS the
  council's surface to classification-honesty**; it does NOT make the gate "ungameable." The floor keys
  off an agent-DECLARED class; L2b (content cross-check) shrinks but does not close that; only the code
  plane (class entailed from the real symbol) closes it. **Do not re-write "can't be gamed."**
- [locked] **RELATION + artifact plane FIRST** (buildable now, binds to the manifest graph + governed
  artifacts); code/SCIP + behavioral planes designed but gated on Codeflair — a code/behavior bind
  ERROR-blocks until wired (fail-closed-until-wired), it never false-passes.
- [locked] **Build directly via TDD, NOT through a governed UACP run.** This Claude Code session has only
  UACP's SKILLS wired in (`.claude/skills` symlinks) — NOT the governed-writer tools (`uacp_entity_write`
  /`uacp_state_write`) or the Heartgate MCP. And you don't bootstrap the framework by running it through
  itself; kernel dev is plain repo software-dev (exempt from the governed-writer rule, like all session work).
- [RESOLVED] **Where the replay engine binds on the FORCED path.** Decided + built: replay runs at
  `verify_exit` (`validate_graph_invariants` re-runs `validate_check_replay` for that scope) AND at
  closure (the `ENGINES` sweep). Coverage (`GP_UNCHECKED_TARGET`) proves a check EXISTS per target at
  verify_exit; replay proves the checks PASS at verify_exit too — a failing/erroring frozen check blocks
  the VERIFY exit, not only closure. (Was a review finding: coverage-at-verify + replay-only-at-closure
  let a run exit VERIFY with failing checks.)

## Rejected / not-this
- **Free-form predicate DSL** for checks — black box; can't validate fail-closed. (→ closed catalog.)
- **Checks inline in the PIV / one check-set artifact per run** — doesn't reuse the projection +
  registration spine; coarser provenance. (→ per-check registered entities + `measured_by`.)
- **Blocking the whole gate on the Codeflair code plane** — slice 0 ships real value on RELATION/artifact
  without it. (→ slice ordering; code plane is slice 3.)
- **gemini as a council reviewer** — mike DROPPED it (2026-06-25). Cross-providers = **kimi + opencode/
  MiniMax-M3** (exact opencode id `minimax-cn-coding-plan/MiniMax-M3`; the obvious spellings 404'd).

## Open threads & watch-outs
- **The classification loophole (the residual the council led with, unanimously).** The required-kinds
  floor's target-class is agent-declared → a mislabel passes L1+L2 with a weak check. L2b + council
  shrink it; full closure needs the code plane. When building L2, do NOT claim it deterministic-closed.
- **Honest #503 scope of slice 0:** closes classes **A** (ERROR≠PASS), **D** (partial — every target has
  a check), **F** (frozen replay, no drift) + the artifact slice of **C**. It does **NOT** close **B**
  (the headline `grep route_mounted` weak-proxy → needs `symbol_resolves`, code-plane) or **E**. The
  node-10 route example is code-plane (slice 3) — say so.
- watch-out: a new `uacp.check.*` kind needs BOTH a schema in `engines/domain/schema.py` AND a layout
  `Entry` (`layout.fmt_of`/`plane_of`) — the entity-writer refuses an unknown kind BEFORE validation.
  Schema alone is not enough. (Council finding; slice 0c.)
- watch-out: `projection._project` is a HARDCODED extractor — the `uacp.check.*` arm is net-new; never
  describe checks as projecting "for free" (the exact built-vs-new dishonesty this initiative fights).
- watch-out: Pyright flags `validate_check_replay` as an unknown import after I added it (stale index) —
  the runtime import works (tests pass). Restart the LSP after structural changes.
- **Manifest integrity (carried from the merged phase):** `manifest.artifacts` — which every check/coverage
  gate trusts — was forgeable via `uacp_state_write`; FIXED in F2 (carve-out). The replay gate inherits
  that trust, so don't re-open it.
- **mike's product note (act on this):** the uacp-handoff skill currently only writes the capsule FILE;
  mike wants it to ALSO emit a **copy-pasteable RESUME PROMPT** for the user to start a fresh session.
  That belongs as a skill enhancement (a RESUME-PROMPT verb/output), tracked here.

## Now → next
- **Position:** slice **0 is BUILT + COUNCILLED + green (suite 1915)** — 0a (replay) + 0b (coverage gate)
  + 0c (governed authoring + `obligation_satisfied`) + hardening + the cross-provider council fixes.
  See Anchors for the commits.
- **Council DONE (the pre-merge gate is satisfied).** Claude subagent lens + cross-provider **kimi** +
  **opencode-go/mimo-v2.5**, all default-to-refute, throwaway-test-grounded. Verdict: 0 surviving
  blockers/majors. Findings, all FIXED: (a) `artifact_integrity` was a no-op PASS (kimi + opencode,
  independent) → now a REAL watermark hash-equality check (no watermark=ERROR, mismatch=FAIL); (b)
  coverage was enforced only at the verify_exit transition (opencode) → `GP_UNCHECKED_TARGET` added to
  the terminal closure set as a backstop; (c) mimo minors — code/behavior plane guard hoisted so ANY
  mislabeled kind ERRORs, `field_equals` now requires `expect`, registry parity made bidirectional, and
  the L1 gap is now PINNED by a test. **Routing note:** the canonical `minimax-cn-coding-plan/MiniMax-M3`
  key was INVALID; an interim `opencode-go/minimax-m3` substitution was REJECTED by mike — use
  **`opencode-go/mimo-v2.5`** (his choice) until the canonical key is re-authed.
- **The from.target↔bind DECOUPLING (carry into L2 — the BLOCKER a reviewer led with).** Coverage proves a
  check NAMES each target, NOT that the check's `bind` (what replay evaluates) is RELEVANT to it. So a
  check that names `wu-1` but binds a trivial field on an unrelated artifact satisfies coverage and can
  pass replay. This is the DESIGNED residual for **L2** (required-kinds floor), **L2b** (content/class
  entailment), **L3** (council), and ultimately the **code plane** (class entailed from the real symbol).
  Slice 0 is L1 (omission) only — named honestly in the `_check_unchecked_target` limit comment; do NOT
  claim slice 0 closes relevance. For graph-plane kinds (`obligation_satisfied`/`edge_exists`) the bind IS
  structural, so L2 could cheaply cross-check bind-relates-to-target there; for `field_*` it's semantic (L3).
- **Next:** (1) **MERGE slice 0** — council satisfied; push the branch + open the PR (0b/0c/hardening/
  council commits are local). (2) Slice **2 = the floor (L2/2b)**: `verification-floor.yaml` + the floor
  engine (`CHK_FLOOR_UNMET`/`CHK_CLASS_UNDERCLAIM`) + the council enumeration of checks-as-claims — this
  is what closes the from.target↔bind decoupling (the pinned L1 gap). Then generator SKILL (slice 1),
  code/SCIP plane (slice 3).
